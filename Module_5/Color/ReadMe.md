# Colors

There are four ways to represent color in CSS:

- Hexadecimal or hex colors

1. Hexadecimal is a number system that has sixteen digits, 0 to 9 followed by “A” to “F”.

2. Hex values always begin with # and specify values of red, blue, and green using hexadecimal numbers such as `#23F41A`.

3. Six-digit hex values with duplicate values for each RGB value can be shorted to three digits.

- RGB

1. RGB colors use the `rgb()` syntax with one value for red, one value for blue and one value for green.

2. RGB values range from 0 to 255 and look like this: `rgb(7, 210, 50)`.

- HSL

1. HSL stands for hue (the color itself), saturation (the intensity of the color), and lightness (how light or dark a color is).

2. Hue ranges from 0 to 360 and saturation and lightness are both represented as percentages like this: `hsl(200, 20%, 50%)`.

3. You can add opacity to color in RGB and HSL by adding a fourth value, `a`, which is represented as a percentage.
